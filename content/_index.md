I'm pursuing a Master's in Electrical Engineering at The Cooper Union, where I also earned a BEng (Computer Engineering track). My thesis explores how to make reinforcement learning more data-efficient and reliable, with [Sam Keene](https://cooper.edu/academics/people/sam-keene) as my advisor.

This site is where I share notes and showcase projects I've worked on, centered around understanding machine learning and its applications.

#### Currently Working On

- writing a thesis on data- and sample-efficient deep reinforcement learning
- building ML that turns unstructured docs into structured data @ [Konsilix](https://www.konsilix.com)
- reviewing ML theory and algorithms
