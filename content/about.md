I'm pursuing my master's in Electrical Engineering at The Cooper Union, where I also earned my Bachelor of Engineering. My thesis explores how to make reinforcement learning more data-efficient and reliable, in collaboration with my advisor, Sam Keene.

This site is where I share notes and showcase projects I've worked on, centered around understanding machine learning and its applications.

At the moment, I'm spending *most* of my time on:  
- completing literature review for MEng thesis  
- studying ML theory and algorithms  
- exploring deployment and system design @ [*Konsilix*](https://www.konsilix.com)
