## Introduction
Briefly describe the project:   

Where it was done? (course, collaboration, exhibiiton, independent)    

- During my Senior Spring Semester (Spring 25') I worked on a project called *Agnes* for the Generative Machine Learning at The Cooper Union.
- The course is a interdisciplinary graduate courses co-taught by Professors. Sam Keene and Benjamin Aranda where art, architecture, and engineering students create generative machine learning projects.


What the core idea is?    

- For our final project my group posed the question: "what if you could interact with a troll" 
- The idea was to use generative ai to create an internet troll that attendees at the exhibition could interact with.
- The idea is that the internet troll could see you and make fun of you in real time.

Where it was presented/submitted?     

- For our final we were asked to create an interactive and generative project that would be displayed at the Generative Machine Learnign (2025). [^1]



## Approach
Explain **how the project works or was carried out**, in broad strokes:

If interactive &rarr; describe the participant experience?    

- Our project consisted of a LED wall, webcam, microphone, speaker, and a monitor to display the webcam feed. 
- The  webcam, microphone, and speaker were to give Agnus the ability to see, hear, and respond to passerbyers in real time.
- The LED Wall was used to display an animated internet troll that was developed by Ben Butler (School of Art 2025).

- Agnus was instructed to sassy, funny, and saracstic to anyone in frame
- she was also asked to initiate conversation with anyone speaking into the mic, using the video feed to make fun of them, and using the dynamic microphone to have a back and forth conversation with attendees.


Include visuals (diagrams, screenshots, demos) that showcase the process? 
- Figure 01: Potetnially a gif of Agnus (need to ask Ben)
- Figure 02: Diagrams: flow chart
- Figure 03: Someone interacting with the project

Reflection
Summarize why the project matters.
-key insights, results, or lessons learned

Attendees seemed impressed and confused by 

-reactions from participants or audience

While most people are familar with the wonders of chat bots and image generations technology is moving quickly, and I felt it first hand when interacting with attendees who were at the exhibition. 

-what makes it important, novel, or distinctive 

This *type* of generative project would not have been possible a year ago.

demo?
- this part can be pushed off till later but it would be interesting, also maybe enforcing a time limit
- 10 min might be too much, maybe by the 2nd min one you'll get the point. 
    - hopefully this also work on mobile but we may be pushing it LOL
- we might need to ask ben for the Agnus file soon.
