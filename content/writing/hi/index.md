Welcome to my first writing post! 

This site exists for two main reasons:
1. it's a way for me to get better at explaining my work (processes and ideas) to make them simpler for anyone to follow. 
2. it organizes my work together in one place with explanations I can reference and share in a format that's more accesible than a GitHub repo [^1].



#### Website


This site is organized into two parts. [Writing](#) contains posts, notes, and explanations that document things I'm learning or exploring. [Portfolio](#) highlights completed projects in their completion, packaged with results and (possibly) interactive demos. 


#### Writing

The Writing section includes different kinds of posts:
- write-ups &rarr; details explanations of projects. 
- notes &rarr; concise explanations of concepts (ML, algorithms, math).
- guides &rarr; practical, step-by-step tutorials on tools and frameworks. 
- reading-list &rarr; collection of papers, articles, or chapters I've been reading.


#### Why

- A short personal note:
  - starting your master's, wanting to share accessible notes and explanations.
  - helping me clarify my own thinking
  - mention generative ML projects (Extraction, Agnus) and how people often asked questions that didn't have an "accessible link".


When writing I would like to be able to reference multiple things. For
example, recently I wrote a report for a submission to NeurIPS Creative
AI Projects [\[2\]](#ref-neurips) for our project *Extraction*.



[^1]: when I would display and talk about my work, I always felt a bit of dissatisfaction with the level of detail that I gave through a conversatoin.
