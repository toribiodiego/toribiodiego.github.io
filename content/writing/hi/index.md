Recently, I've felt dissatisifed with my explanations of my work. Conversations about my work felt incomplete without anything to *show*. This site lets me share both the process and results in one place.

The site has two sections: [Portfolio](/portfolio/) and [Writing](/writing/). Portfolio highlights complete projects with short summaries, images, tables, and demos.

Writing goes more into detail on projects and material I'm exploring. Posts are grouped into the following categories:

<figure class="post-table">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Tag</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>write-ups</code></td>
        <td>Detailed explanations of projects</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>notes</code></td>
        <td>Concise explanations of concepts (ML, algorithms, math)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>guides</code></td>
        <td>Practical, step-by-step tutorials on tools and frameworks</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>reading-list</code></td>
        <td>Collections of papers, articles, or chapters I've been reading</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</figure>

Through writing, I hope to better understand my work and share resources with others who may be working on similar problems.
