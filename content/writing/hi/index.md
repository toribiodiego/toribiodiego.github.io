Recently, I've felt dissatisifed with my explanations of my work. Conversations about my work felt incomplete without anything to *show*. This site lets me share both the process and results in one place.

The site has two sections: [Portfolio](#) and [Writing](#). Portfolio highlights complete projects with short summaries, images, tables, and demos.

Writing goes more into detail on projects and material I'm exploring. Posts are grouped into the following categories:

<br>

| Tag          | Description                                                   |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `write-ups`   | Detailed explanations of projects                          |
| `notes`       | Concise explanations of concepts (ML, algorithms, math)   |
| `guides`      | Practical, step-by-step tutorials on tools and frameworks |
| `reading-list`| Collections of papers, articles, or chapters I’ve been reading |

<br>

Through writing, I hope to better understand my work and share resources with others who may be working on similar problems.
